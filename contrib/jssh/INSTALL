These instructions assume that you are running Linux.

1.  You will have already run "tar xvfz jssh-x.y.z.tar.gz" to extract 
    the contents of the tarball, thus creating a directory "jssh".

2.  Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the name of your Java
    SDK installation directory. For example,

	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.3.1_01

3.  Change directory to "jssh" and run "make". This will compile
    the Java source files and build the JAR file in "jssh/lib/jssh.jar".
    It will also run "javadoc" and create API documentation for the 
    JSSH library, in HTML format. The documentation is created in 
    the "jssh/doc" directory.
