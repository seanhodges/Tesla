Short term objectives:

The UI, new widgets and styling
Multiple DBUS configurations
Decide how application is selected (during new connection? selection switch using the menu button?)
Run SSH commands in background (probably as a service)
Package and sign for market

Long term objectives:

Loading DBUS configurations from filesystem
Dependency injection (dynamic resolution of connection/dbus/commandfactory objects
"Command queue" to provide more control over the stream of commands being sent by the UI
Connection profile manager (save/load connection config)
