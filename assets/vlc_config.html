		<h1>VLC set-up instructions</h1>
		
		<p>VLC does not allow you to interface with it remotely by default. To use it with Tesla, you must first turn on the <i>D-Bus remote interface</i> in the preferences:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Start the VLC player.</li>
			
			<li>In the top menu, select <b>Tools</b> and <b>Preferences...</b></li>
			
			<li>At the bottom of the preferences dialog, select the <b>All</b> radio button under <b>Show settings</b>.</li>
			
			<li>The left panel should become a tree list, expand the <b>Interfaces</b> group, and click on <b>Control Interfaces</b>.</li>
			
			<li>Tick the checkbox labeled <b>D-Bus control interface</b>.</li>
			
			<li>Click <b>Save</b> to close the preferences dialog.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>You should now be able to connect to VLC from Tesla, and your setting should be remembered from now on.</p>
